Sir David wins the battle buy using his goggles lasering down the villian
by the help of his pet human side-kick, Morty. Plot twist, the laser beam gets reflected by Tengil's
helmet and instead hits Morty right in the chest. Morty is thrown to the ground, dead.
The hero, Sir David, starts to cry. He's really an imposter that got knighted by the king
for no real reason. Sir David picks Morty up in his arms and walks back to the village. He later
pretends that he defeated Tengil.
